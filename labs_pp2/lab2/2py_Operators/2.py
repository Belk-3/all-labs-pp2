# here we talk math operators and others (a lot xDDD)
# so the first is a basic math operators
print(5+7)
print(7-4)
print(8*5)
print(8/2)
print(2**2)
print(12//5)
print(13/3)

# the next one is Assignment  operators or shorter operaters
x = 5
x += 2
x -= 1
x *= 2
x /= 4
x //= 2
x %= 1
x **= 2
# i will write only main xDD becouse i dont know bitwise heh

#Comparison Operators
#its easy math compare
5 > 4
5 < 9
7 >= 0
8 <= 2
8 == 8
8 != 2

# then logical operators
#and
#or
#not

# identity operators
#is
#is not

#Membership Operators
# we use it when we wanna know : is value x in list a ?
# it will return true or false
