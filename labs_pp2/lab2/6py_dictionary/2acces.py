#You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]


#There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
x = thisdict.get("model")


#The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.keys()


#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"
print(x) #after the change


#The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.values()


#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change


#The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
x = thisdict.items()

#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change
